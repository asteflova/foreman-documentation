= Setting up Your System Management Infrastructure

First we need to set up the basic components required to begin our setup. In most customer environments, some of these components already exist.

Perform a basic configuration of Sat6 and its embedded Capsule. We also create an organization and import the subscription manifest.

Corresponding Satellite 6 Entities: Satellite 6 Installer, Organization, and Subscription Manifest
Outcome: You now have an up-and-running system management infrastructure and your Red Hat subscription manifest uploaded and activated.
