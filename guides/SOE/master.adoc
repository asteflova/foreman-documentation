= Setting up Your System Management Infrastructure

Perform a basic configuration of {ProjectServer} and its embedded {SmartProxy}.

You will be dealing with the following {Project} components and concepts:

== Prerequisites

* You must have a {ProjectServer} installed on a {EL} host. See {InstallingServerDocURL}[{InstallingServerDocTitle}] and {InstallingServerDisconnectedDocURL}[{InstallingServerDisconnectedDocTitle}].
