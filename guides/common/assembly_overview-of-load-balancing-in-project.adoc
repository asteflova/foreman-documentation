= Overview of load balancing in {Project}

You can configure {ProjectServer} to use a load balancer to distribute client requests and network load across multiple {SmartProxyServers}.
This results in an overall performance improvement on {SmartProxyServers}.
In a load-balanced setup, {SmartProxy} functionality supported for load balancing continues to work as expected when one {SmartProxyServer} is down for planned or unplanned maintenance.
