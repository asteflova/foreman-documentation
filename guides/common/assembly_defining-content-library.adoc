Import software content into Satellite 6, focusing on different software entry points and formats.
The content includes RPM packages and Puppet modules for Red Hat, third-party, and custom applications.

Corresponding Entities: Products, Repositories, Third-party and custom GPG Keys and Sync Plans.

Outcome: You have defined multiple custom and third-party Products and Repositories, successfully imported their corresponding content, and enabled continual updates of content using synchronization plans.

A Definitive Media Library is a repository that stores and protects the definitive, authorized versions of software and configurations.
The corresponding change-and-release management process ensures that these configurations are tested and quality-assured before they are deployed to production.
