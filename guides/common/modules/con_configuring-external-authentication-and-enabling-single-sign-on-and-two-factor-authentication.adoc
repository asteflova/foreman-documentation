= Configuring external authentication and enabling single sign-on and two-factor authentication

If you store users in an external identity provider, you can connect the provider to your {ProjectServer} to enable these users to log in to {Project}.
Some external identity providers also enable you to implement authentication features such as single sign-on or two-factor authentication in {Project}, providing an additional layer of security.

{Project} derives user and user group permissions based on user group membership defined in the external identity provider.
