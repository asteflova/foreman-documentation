= Configuring Active Directory as an external identity provider for {Project}

You can configure direct Active Directory (AD) integration to use the AD server as an external authentication source for your {ProjectServer}.
With direct AD integration, your {ProjectServer} is joined directly to the AD domain that stores user accounts.
