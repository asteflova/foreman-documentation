= Configuring Active Directory as an external identity provider for {Project}

This section shows how to use direct Active Directory (AD) as an external authentication source for {ProjectServer}.
Direct AD integration means that {ProjectServer} is joined directly to the AD domain where the identity is stored.

[NOTE]
====
You can attach Active Directory as an external authentication source with no single sign-on support.
