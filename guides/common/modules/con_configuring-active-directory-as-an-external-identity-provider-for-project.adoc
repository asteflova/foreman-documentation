= Configuring Active Directory as an external identity provider for {Project}

You can configure direct Active Directory (AD) integration to use the AD server as an external authentication source for your {ProjectServer}.
With direct AD integration, your {ProjectServer} is joined directly to the AD domain that stores user accounts.

With an AD server configured as an external identity provider, users that belong to the Kerberos realm for the AD domain can log in to {ProjectServer}.
