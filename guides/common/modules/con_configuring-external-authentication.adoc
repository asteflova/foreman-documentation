[id="Configuring_External_Authentication_{context}"]
= Configuring external authentication

By using external authentication you can derive user and user group permissions from user group membership in an external identity provider.
When you use external authentication, you do not have to create these users and maintain their group membership manually on {ProjectServer}.
In case the external source does not provide email, it will be requested during the first login through {ProjectWebUI}.

.Important user and group account information
All user and group accounts must be local accounts.
This is to ensure that there are no authentication conflicts between local accounts on your {ProjectServer} and accounts in your Active Directory domain.

Your system is not affected by this conflict if your user and group accounts exist in both `/etc/passwd` and `/etc/group` files.
For example, to check if entries for `puppet`, `{apache-user}`, `foreman` and `foreman-proxy` groups exist in both `/etc/passwd` and `/etc/group` files, enter the following commands:

[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,verbatim,attributes"]
----
# cat /etc/passwd | grep 'puppet\|{apache-user}\|foreman\|foreman-proxy'
# cat /etc/group | grep 'puppet\|{apache-user}\|foreman\|foreman-proxy'
