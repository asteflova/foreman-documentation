= Lifecycle environments and environment paths

Application lifecycles are divided into *lifecycle environments* which represent each stage of the application lifecycle.
By linking lifecycle environments, you create an *environment path*.

You can promote content along the environment path to the next lifecycle environment when required.
When you promote a content view from one environment to the next environment in the application lifecycle, {Project} updates the repository and publishes the packages.
For example, if development ends on a particular version of an application, you can promote this version to the testing environment and start development on the next version.
