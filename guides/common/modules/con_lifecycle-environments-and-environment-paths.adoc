= Lifecycle environments and environment paths

Application lifecycles are divided into *lifecycle environments* which represent each stage of the application lifecycle.
By linking lifecycle environments, you create an *environment path*.

You can promote content along the environment path to the next lifecycle environment when required.
When you promote a content view from one environment to the next environment in the application lifecycle, {Project} updates the repository and publishes the packages.
For example, if development ends on a particular version of an application, you can promote this version to the testing environment and start development on the next version.

.Promoting a package from _Development_ to _Testing_
====
The repositories for _Testing_ and _Production_ contain the `_my-software_-1.0-0.{client-pkg-arch}.{client-pkg-ext}` package:

|===
| | Development | Testing | Production

| Version of the content view | Version 2 | Version 1 | Version 1
| Contents of the content view | _my-software_-1.1-0.{client-pkg-arch}.{client-pkg-ext} | _my-software_-1.0-0.{client-pkg-arch}.{client-pkg-ext} | _my-software_-1.0-0.{client-pkg-arch}.{client-pkg-ext}
|===

If you promote Version 2 of the content view from _Development_ to _Testing_, the repository for _Testing_ updates to contain the `_my-software_-1.1-0.{client-pkg-arch}.{client-pkg-ext}` package:

|===
| | Development | Testing | Production

| Version of the content view | Version 2 | *Version 2* | Version 1
| Contents of the content view | _my-software_-1.1-0.{client-pkg-arch}.{client-pkg-ext} | *_my-software_-1.1-0.{client-pkg-arch}.{client-pkg-ext}* | _my-software_-1.0-0.{client-pkg-arch}.{client-pkg-ext}
|===

This ensures hosts are designated to a specific environment but receive updates when that environment uses a new version of the content view.
