= Additional maintenance required for load balancing

Configuring {SmartProxies} to use a load balancer results in a more complex environment and requires additional maintenance.

The following additional steps are required for load balancing:

* You must ensure that all {SmartProxies} have the same content views and synchronize all {SmartProxies} to the same content view versions.
* You must upgrade each {SmartProxy} in sequence.
