= Additional maintenance required for load balancing

Configuring {SmartProxies} to use a load balancer results in a more complex environment and requires additional maintenance.

The following additional steps are required for load balancing:

* You must ensure that all {SmartProxies} have the same content views and synchronize all {SmartProxies} to the same content view versions
* You must upgrade each {SmartProxy} in sequence
* You must backup each {SmartProxy} that you configure regularly

To troubleshoot issues, you must reproduce the issue on each {SmartProxy}, bypassing the load balancer.
Configuring a {SmartProxyServer} for load balancing does not use Pacemaker or other similar HA tools to maintain one state across all {SmartProxies}.
