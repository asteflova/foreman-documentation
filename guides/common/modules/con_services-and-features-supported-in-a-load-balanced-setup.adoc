= Services and features supported in a load-balanced setup

A load balancer in {Project} distributes load only for the following services and features:

* Registering hosts
* Providing content to hosts
* Configuring hosts by using Puppet

You must access other services, such as provisioning, `virt-who`, or remote execution, directly through the individual {SmartProxies} on which these services are running.
