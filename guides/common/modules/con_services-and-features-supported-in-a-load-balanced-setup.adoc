= Services and features supported in a load-balanced setup

A load balancer works with the following services and features:

* Registration using `subscription-manager`
* Content management with Yum repositories
* Optional: Puppet

[NOTE]
====
In the load-balanced setup, a load balancer distributes load only for the services and features mentioned above.
If other services, such as provisioning or virt-who, are running on the individual {SmartProxies}, you must access them directly through {SmartProxies} and not through the load balancer.
