= Services and features supported in a load-balanced setup

A load balancer in {Project} distributes load only for the following services and features:

* Registration using `subscription-manager`
* Content management with Yum repositories
* Puppet

You must access other services, such as provisioning, virt-who, or remote execution, directly through {SmartProxies}, and not through the load balancer.
