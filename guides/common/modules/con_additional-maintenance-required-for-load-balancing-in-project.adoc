= Additional maintenance required for load balancing in {Project}

Configuring {SmartProxies} to use a load balancer results in a more complex environment and requires additional maintenance.

The following additional steps are required for load balancing:

* You must upgrade each {SmartProxy} in sequence
* You must backup each {SmartProxy} that you configure regularly
