= Prerequisites for configuring {Project} with {keycloak-quarkus} authentication

* A {keycloak} account with administrative privileges.
* A {keycloak} server that uses HTTPS instead of HTTP and has been initialized with the `--http-relative-path=/auth` context path.
To access a {keycloak} server initialized with `--http-relative-path=/auth` from its web UI, go to `https://_{keycloak-example-com}_:8443/auth`.
+
[NOTE]
====
To use a different context path, make manual adjustments after the initialisation with `/auth` or configure the `_foreman-openidc_oidc_keycloak_Foreman_Realm_.conf` file of the HTTPd service manually.

====
* If the certificates or the CA are self-signed, add them to the end-user certificate truststore.
* A {keycloak} realm created for {Project} user accounts, for example `_{Project}_Realm_`.
* Users imported or added to {keycloak}.
