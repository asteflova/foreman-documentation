= Configuring Active Directory integrated with {FreeIPA} through cross-forest Kerberos trust as an external identity provider for {Project}

Kerberos can create `cross-forest trust` that defines a relationship between two otherwise separate domain forests.
A domain forest is a hierarchical structure of domains; both AD and {FreeIPA} constitute a forest.
With a trust relationship enabled between AD and {FreeIPA}, users of AD can access Linux hosts and services using a single set of credentials.
