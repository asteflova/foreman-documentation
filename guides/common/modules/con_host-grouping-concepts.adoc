= Host grouping concepts

Apart from the physical topology of {SmartProxyServers}, {ProjectName} provides several logical units for grouping hosts.
Hosts that are members of those groups inherit the group configuration.
For example, the simple parameters that define the provisioning environment can be applied at the following levels:

[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,verbatim,attributes"]
----
Global > Organization > Location > Domain > Host group > Host
----
The main logical groups in {ProjectName} are:


* *Organizations* – the highest level logical groups for hosts.
Organizations provide a strong separation of content and configuration.
Each organization requires a separate Red{nbsp}Hat Subscription Manifest, and can be thought of as a separate virtual instance of a {ProjectServer}.
Avoid the use of organizations if a lower level host grouping is applicable.

* *Locations* – a grouping of hosts that should match the physical location.
Locations can be used to map the network infrastructure to prevent incorrect host placement or configuration.
For example, you cannot assign a subnet, domain, or compute resources directly to a {SmartProxyServer}, only to a location.

* *Host groups* – the main carriers of host definitions including assigned Puppet classes, Content View, or operating system.
It is recommended to configure the majority of settings at the host group level instead of defining hosts directly.
Configuring a new host then largely becomes a matter of adding it to the right host group.
As host groups can be nested, you can create a structure that best fits your requirements (see xref:host-group-structures_{context}[]).

* *Host collections* – a host registered to {ProjectServer} for the purpose of subscription and content management is called *content host*.
Content hosts can be organized into host collections, which enables performing bulk actions such as package management or errata installation.

Locations and host groups can be nested.
Organizations and host collections are flat.
