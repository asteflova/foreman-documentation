= Enabling and synchronizing the {project-client-name} repository

The {project-client-name} repository provides the `katello-host-tools` and `puppet` packages for hosts registered to {Project}.
You must periodically synchronize the repository from the Red Hat Content Delivery Network (CDN) to your {ProjectServer} and enable the repository on your hosts.
