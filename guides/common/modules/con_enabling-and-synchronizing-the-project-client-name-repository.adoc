= Enabling and synchronizing the {project-client-name} repository

The {project-client-name} repository provides the `katello-host-tools` and `puppet` packages for clients registered to {ProjectServer}.
You must enable the repository for each {RHEL} version that you need to manage on hosts, and then periodically synchronize the repository from the Red Hat Content Delivery Network (CDN) to your {Project}.
