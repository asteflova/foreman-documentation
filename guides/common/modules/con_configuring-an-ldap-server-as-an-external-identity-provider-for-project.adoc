= Configuring an LDAP server as an external identity provider for {Project}

Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) is a set of open protocols used to access centrally stored information over a network. With {Project}, you can manage LDAP entirely through the {ProjectWebUI}.

[NOTE]
====
Though you can use LDAP to connect to a Red Hat Identity Management or AD server, the setup does not support server discovery, cross-forest trusts, or single sign-on with Kerberos in {ProjectWebUI}.
