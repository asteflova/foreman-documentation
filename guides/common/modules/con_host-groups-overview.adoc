= Host groups overview

A host group acts as a template for common host settings.

With host groups, you can define many settings for hosts, such as lifecycle environment, content view, or Ansible roles that are available to the hosts.
Instead of defining the settings individually for each host, you can use host groups to define common settings once and apply them to multiple hosts.

You can create nested host groups.

IMPORTANT: When you change the settings of an existing host group, the new settings do not propagate to the hosts assigned to the host group.
Only Puppet class settings get updated on hosts after you change them in the host group.
