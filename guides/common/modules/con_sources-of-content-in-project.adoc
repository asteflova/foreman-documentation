Red{nbsp}Hat content::
The Red{nbsp}Hat subscription manifest determines what Red{nbsp}Hat repositories your {ProjectServer} can access.
Red{nbsp}Hat content is already organized into products.
+
For example, {RHEL}{nbsp}Server is a product in {Project}.
The repositories for the {RHEL}{nbsp}Server product consist of different versions, architectures, and add-ons.
When you enable a Red{nbsp}Hat repository, {Project} automatically creates an associated product.

Other sources of content::
To distribute content from custom sources, you must create products and repositories manually.
You can organize other content into {customproduct}s however you want.
+
For example, you can create an EPEL (Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux) product and add an "EPEL 9 x86_64" repository to it.
