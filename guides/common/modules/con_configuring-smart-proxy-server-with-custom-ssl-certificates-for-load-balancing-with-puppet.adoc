= Configuring {SmartProxyServer} with custom SSL certificates for load balancing with Puppet

If you use Puppet in your {Project} setup, you can configure one or more {SmartProxyServers} that use custom SSL certificates for load balancing.

To do this, you create custom SSL certificates and configure Puppet certificate signing on one of your {SmartProxyServers}.
Then, you configure each other {SmartProxy} used for load balancing to use the certificates.
The first {SmartProxyServer} will generate and sign Puppet certificates for the other {SmartProxies} configured for load balancing.
