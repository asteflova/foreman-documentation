= Organizations, locations, and lifecycle environments

{ProjectName} takes a consolidated approach to Organization and Location management.
System administrators define multiple Organizations and multiple Locations in a single {ProjectServer}.
For example, a company might have three Organizations (Finance, Marketing, and Sales) across three countries (United States, United Kingdom, and Japan).
In this example, {ProjectServer} manages all Organizations across all geographical Locations, creating nine distinct contexts for managing systems.
In addition, users can define specific locations and nest them to create a hierarchy.
For example, {Project} administrators might divide the United States into specific cities, such as Boston, Phoenix, or San Francisco.

.Example topology for {ProjectName}

{ProjectServer} defines all locations and organizations.
Each respective {Project} {SmartProxyServer} synchronizes content and handles configuration of systems in a different location.

The main {ProjectServer} retains the management function, while the content and configuration is synchronized between the main {ProjectServer} and a {Project} {SmartProxyServer} assigned to certain locations.
