= Components of a load-balanced setup

A load-balanced setup in a {Project} environment consists of the following components:

* {ProjectServer}
* Two or more {SmartProxyServers}
* A load balancer
* Multiple hosts

A host sends a request to the TCP load balancer.
The load balancer receives the request and determines which {SmartProxyServer} will handle the request to ensure optimal performance and availability.
