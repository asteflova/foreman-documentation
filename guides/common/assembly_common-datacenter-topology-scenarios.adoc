= Common datacenter topology scenarios

You can use {SmartProxyServers} to scale out your {Project} deployment.

You can create various {SmartProxies} in different geographical locations where datacenters are located.
These are centrally managed through your {ProjectServer}.

By making your datacenter topology fit your needs, hosts in your distributed locations can communicate to the {SmartProxy} instead of directly to your {ProjectServer} itself.
You can also select which particular content subset is managed by a specific
capsule and, therefore, made available to the hosts behind the capsule. For example, a
capsule associated with a particular lifecycle environment only provides the content (views) available in this environments to its hosts.

== Single location

An _integrated {SmartProxy}_ is a virtual {SmartProxyServer} that is created by default in {ProjectServer} during the installation process.
This means {ProjectServer} can be used to provision directly connected hosts for {Project} deployment in a single geographical location, therefore only one physical server is needed.
The base systems of isolated {SmartProxies} can be directly managed by {ProjectServer}, however it is not recommended to use this layout to manage other hosts in remote locations.

== Single location with segregated subnets

Your infrastructure might require multiple isolated subnets even if {ProjectName} is deployed in a single geographic location.
This can be achieved for example by deploying multiple {SmartProxyServers} with DHCP and DNS services, but the recommended way is to create segregated subnets using a single {SmartProxy}.
This {SmartProxy} is then used to manage hosts and compute resources in those segregated networks to ensure they only have to access the {SmartProxy} for provisioning, configuration, errata, and general management.
For more information on configuring subnets see {ManagingHostsDocURL}[_Managing Hosts_].

== Multiple locations

It is recommended to create at least one {SmartProxyServer} per geographic location.
This practice can save bandwidth since hosts obtain content from a local {SmartProxyServer}.
Synchronization of content from remote repositories is done only by the {SmartProxy}, not by each host in a location.
In addition, this layout makes the provisioning infrastructure more reliable and easier to configure.
